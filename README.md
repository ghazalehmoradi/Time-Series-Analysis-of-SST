# Time Series Analysis of SST 
This project analyzes Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies, collected from 1950 to 2019, in order to ﬁnd any potential (long-term) trends which could indicate climate change. A time series model is ﬁtted to SST anomalies and their trend and seasonality are tested. Running a few diagnostic tests, as well as ACF and PACF of ﬁtted residuals of ARIMA(3,0,4) lead me to choose this model as the best-ﬁtted model. However, a large lag outside of the Conﬁdence Interval in PACF in ﬁtted residuals of this model, lead me to perform spectral analysis and remove seasonality. Surprisingly, ACF and PACF of the resulting model became worse, and it failed to pass the Box-Ljung squared test. Most importantly, ACF and PACF of the ﬁtted residuals still had a large lag outside the CI. This made me perform the forecast on the original data instead of the ARIMA model (after diﬀerencing seasonality). The result of the forecast shows a decrease in SST anomalies which could mean a cooling trend in global climate.
